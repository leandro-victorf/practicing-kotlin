# practicing-kotlin
A place reserved for practice and study in Kotlin

In this work I will practice some techniques in Kotlin, based on the Object Oriented Programming course of Professor Dr. Paule Henrique Pasini at UFABC in the second quarter of 2021.

The statements will be made available in each project, since the website that contains them is exclusive to the institution's students.
